DESCRIPTION:
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

EXAMPLE:
(input --> output)

"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"

DOMAIN:
A and T are complements
C and G are complements
Function receives 1 side of DNA (string, except for Haskell)
Return the other complementary side
DNA strand is never empty
There is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell)

DETAILS of DOMAIN: 
If A - returns T
If C - return G
Function receives 1 side
Return the other complementary side
DNA != null or ' '

POMODORO 1: DRIVER: JULIANA
- Create project and organize code 
- Start DOMAIN and understand the task 
- Create first test: ("Should return 'T' when the function receives 'A'")
- Make test fail
- Create prode code
- Make test pass
